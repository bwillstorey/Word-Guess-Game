## About
- A basic word-guess / hangman game built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to the theme of 1991's "Point Break". The game responds to user keystrokes (a-z, A-Z only) and dynamically responds using event listeners to update the viewport with correct/incorrect submissions. A correct answer wins the round, 10 wrong guesses resets the round. 5 round wins successfully completes the game.
